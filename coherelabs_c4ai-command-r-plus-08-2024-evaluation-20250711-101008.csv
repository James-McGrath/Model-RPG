Response A: 9/10
Response B: 7/10
Response C: 4/10

[Explanation]
Response A is the most engaging and in-character response, providing a warm welcome while also setting the scene and establishing the guard's role. It invites the player to share their purpose, which is a great way to encourage role-play and interaction.

Response B is also friendly, but it lacks the depth of A. It provides a simple warning, which is helpful, but doesn't offer much in terms of character or world-building.

Response C is a bit abrupt and doesn't seem to fit the context. The mention of a plague is intriguing, but it doesn't provide any further information or interaction, which is essential in a role-playing game.
