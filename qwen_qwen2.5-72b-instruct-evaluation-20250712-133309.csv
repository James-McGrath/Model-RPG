Only respond with your reasoning and your ranking (A, B, C). Do not repeat the prompt or the responses.
Reasoning: Response A sets the scene well, introduces the character, and asks relevant questions that fit the role of a guard. It encourages further interaction and maintains the immersive quality of the roleplaying experience. Response B is also appropriate but less engaging as it lacks the initial introduction and questioning that adds depth to the character. Response C is the least suitable as it introduces an element (the plague) without context and does not properly establish the character or the setting.
